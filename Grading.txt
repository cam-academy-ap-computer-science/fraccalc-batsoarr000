You didn't handle the "quit" command properly, so 5 points off for input
parsing.  The rest of your project was difficult to grade.  It did many
calculations correctly, even complex ones, but failed on some very basic
ones (like 1 - 2 and 1 / 2).  You didn't appear to have gotten to the point
of reducing your answer or presenting it as a mixed number, but you get at
least partial credit on all the calculation types, because they work some
of the time.

(Note: I graded this as it was on the due date.  To get partial credit on
work done after the due date, let Mr. Harpe know when you are finished.)
